        Maybe the purest form of saunter there is having no plan at all. In a world where technology has made it much more difficult to get lost, you could very well use your saunter to put your phone away and let your feet guide you way. You could very realistically show up to start walking on May 17th with no set route in mind and then just proceed to head south. Seattle's geography makes it a little easier to do that without getting lost. If you do get lost, you can always whip out your phone and get back on track. Or better yet you could ask for directions like all of your ancestors in the olden days.

          You can very easily blend the desire to have a non-scripted adventure with not wanting to get completely lost. The way to do that is by not checking your phone for directions until you get to a certain point, say for example the ship canal, or I-90, or Seward Park. It is very unlikely that anyone will intuitively know where the southernmost point of the city is, so unless you are incredibly well familiar with south Seattle it may be a good idea to have your phone handy to get you to the end.

        As someone who walked across the city, region, state and country I feel uniquely qualified to offer a suggested route for you to walk the length of Seattle.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        What I have prioritized in a suggested route is reducing exposure to cars, seeing some of Seattle's lovely parks, getting some access to the lakefront, variety, view points, access to some lunch spots in the middle portion of the day, and keeping at a reasonable 20 miles. It also is a route that provides some flexibility and in no way shape or form needs to be followed to a T.

      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{ mb: 4, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        If you are looking to build a route, the best place to start is through your preferred map app. I generally use <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@47.6491813,-122.3063363,11z/data=!5m1!1e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Google Maps</a> and suggest using the web version of it. When you plug in the start point the Shoreline South Light Rail station and the end point Garden of Gethsemane into google maps using the "walking" option you get a pretty straightforward route that will take about 18 miles. I do not recommend this route because it won't be that interesting and you will find yourself on pretty busy roads for a good chunk of it. Instead use this as a template to get a better sense of where you would like to pass through.

        <Typography sx={{ mb: 2, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
          Generally, people like to walk in areas with few cars. If you are a masochist and that is not you, might I suggest Aurora, Lake City Way, Rainier, and MLK Jr Way. But for the normal person looking for a more pleasant saunter my first suggestion would be to check out the bike layer on google maps. It is a good resource to show you where the trails are in the city. Another great resource is the <a href='https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/bike-map' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>bike web map</a> of the city. Generally places that are great to bike are great to walk including trails and neighborhood greenways. For those unfamiliar with neighborhood greenways they are residential streets designed to slow car traffic, making them pleasant places to walk. They also have signs guiding your way making them very easy to follow.

            If your goal is to maximize the amount of trails and reduce your exposure to traffic my suggestion would be similar to my suggested route with a few tweaks. First you want to make your way to the Burke Gilman along Lake Washington, from there head south to cross the montlake bridge and make your way over the newly completed pedestrian lid spanning 520 to the arboretum, enjoy your stroll through the arboretum and head to Lake Washington Blvd, this follow this along the lake and this will bring you all the way to Seward Park. After this you will need to navigate your way until the end, but this route is the best way to reduce your exposure to cars

          You're gonna build up an appetite while walking, so you may want to think about where you will want to get lunch. It could just be a scenic viewpoint where you enjoy a packed lunch or something you buy from the grocery store. On the other hand it could be an opportunity to try a new restaurant somewhere along your way. Never hurts to support a small local business and there are plenty of great restaurants in the city to help power you through the rest of your journey.

            There are so many restaurants in this city that it would be impossible to suggest one (unless they reached out to me about providing a special deal to folks Sauntering wink wink nudge nudge). But it is important to think that you will probably be in the central part of the city around lunch time. You also may not want something that is going to weigh you down when you start back walking. Bahn Mi's are always a good, light lunch option and there are plenty of affordable spots from U-District down to Little Saigon.

          Crossing the ship canal
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mb: 2, lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
          Being that the ship canal divides the city and there are only 6 places to cross it on foot, it serves as an important feature to think about how you will traverse the city. The six crossings being the Montlake, University, Fremont, Aurora, Ballard bridges, and the Locks. Each lends itself to seeing a different part of the city and can play a crucial role in determining your route. The Montlake bridge makes sense if you would like to stay close to lake washington. The University bridge makes it easier for you to pass through cap hill. The Fremont bridge will allow you to walk through Greenlake, Wallingford, Fremont, and then Westlake and South Lake Union before heading downtown. The Aurora bridge is kind of a wild card because although you are walking on the side of the highway, you will have the best views of all the bridges and puts you in a position to pass through Queen Anne. The Ballard Bridge is the least pleasant to cross with its narrow sidewalks and busy traffic, but from there you can head through Interbay and link up with the Elliott Bay trail to get some great waterfront views. Lastly, the locks are a Seattle staple, but will be the longest detour. Crossing at the locks lend itself to seeing Ballard and Magnolia.

          The great thing about living in a city the size of Seattle is there is always something going on. This can be a blessing or a curse. Sometimes you stumble upon a friendly and welcoming Indonesian independence day celebration and sometimes you stumble upon an endless stream of loud and belligerent motorcyclists on a bombsquad takeover, who don't like being flipped off. Sometimes they are on the same day (true story). Needless to say there are always things going on like farmers markets, concerts, sporting events, festivals, etc. and you can either make a point to visit them or a point to avoid them when planning your route, or you can serendipitously stumble upon them. The intended date is May 17th and if you are interested to see what's happening that weekend check out <a href='https://event12.com/Seattle' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>event12.com/Seattle</a>.

            Don't give the bird to belligerent people on motorcycles, no matter how annoying they are. A thumbs down would suffice. Also the U-district farmers market will be in full swing on that Saturday and there is always something at the Seattle center. Other events to consider on May 17th are the Norwegian Constitution Day celebration in Ballard and the Kendrick Lamar concert happening at Lumen field.

            A key component of the Seattle Super Saunter is the fact there is no set route. There is a start point and an endpoint and how you get between those two points is up to you. With that being said we believe it is important to provide some sense of direction as most people partaking have never done anything like this before. There are three options for you to consider on how you want to Saunter and we discuss them each below: no route, suggested route, or build your own route.
          </Typography>

          <NoRoute />
